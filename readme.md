# **Smart Comments Generator**

This is a legacy project. It was made as a joke around 2017 (before any AI stuff existed). Yes. The text generated is completely made out of pure RNG. There is no AI involved in the process (the secret sauce is in the templates).

### How does this works?

- Presents a simple form from where you select your template.

- Press "Comentar!" to generate a new commentary.

- Profit?

### **What works**

Everything. But keep in mind that this was an app made as a joke. There's not template editor to help with the creation of custom templates. If you want a custom template, you need to make one by hand. Even tho. The format isn't hard to understand, and the json can be validated with the `"Schemas/schema_textcomments_v3.json"` schema. 

Also. This code uses a fragment of an old framework that I had for UI stuff that had known problems with old OS's. So, is most likely that if you try to run this under win7 or older, it would fail.

### **Working on**

- Nothing. This is a legacy project and won't be updated unless something really big is needed to be added (The actual code is quite a mess and I won't refactor an old joke project just for the sake of code cleanliness).

### **Building**

Visual studio 2022 with .NetFramework 4.7.2 installed. Even tho. Is also compatible with old versions of .NetFramework, since originally this was made for the 3.5 version.

### **Tested on**

Windows 10 22H2 (19045.6332).
